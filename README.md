# [Artastic-Gifs](https://alejosjen.github.io/Artastic-Gifs/)
Calls Giphy API with Javascript and displays an array of images based off a search term, either clicked or entered by the user.
The theme is art-based media or terms, search terms buttons are dynamically created in Javascript. When clicked the button returns 10 gifs, the title, the url, and the rating G. 

To USE: 
Click any of the search terms to pull 10 results.
Actively search the API by typing in a word in the text area, and the app will save your word for you!

To ENJOY:
The pictures are loaded static, or umoving, when clicked, the picture animates.

Input validations:
The enter key had to be disabled in the user input area because it kept refreshing the page and adding to the array without creating a button. An alert is created if a user forgets and tries to duplicate search terms.

Thanks for reading, any kind comments and suggestions are always welcome.
