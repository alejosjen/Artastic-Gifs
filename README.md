# [Artastic-Gifs](https://alejosjen.github.io/Artastic-Gifs/)
Calls Giphy API with Javascript. This actually works!
The theme is art based, starting search terms are in Javascript created buttons. When clicked the button returns 10 gifs, the title, the url, and the rating G. The user can add to the search terms by clicking the submit button and call 10 gifs to the page with their own search. 
The pictures are loaded static, and when clicked, the picture animates, the function is from an if statement that swaps the still and .gif file.

Some error checking:
The enter key had to be disabled in the user input area because it kept refreshing the page and adding to the array without creating a button. There is also an alert that takes care of a user attempting to duplicate search terms, and the term won't be added to the search buttons.

Thanks for reading, any kind comments and suggestions are always welcome.
